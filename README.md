# Brute-Force Attack Simulator üéØ

This project is a simple, static website designed for educational purposes. It serves as a safe and legal target for students learning about cybersecurity and how brute-force attacks work. The goal is to demonstrate the principles of automation, password hashing, and basic security measures like rate limiting in a hands-on way.

## üöÄ Live Demo

You can see the live challenge page here:

## üéØ The Challenge

Your mission is to write a script (e.g., using **Python with Selenium**) that can automatically interact with the live demo page to discover the correct 4-digit PIN.

Your script must be able to:
1.  Open the webpage in a browser.
2.  Iterate through all possible 4-digit PINs (`0000` to `9999`).
3.  Enter each PIN into the input box and click the "EXECUTE" button.
4.  Detect when the correct PIN is found by checking for the redirect to `success.html`.

## ‚ú® Features

This simulation includes several features to make the challenge more realistic and educational:

* **Realistic Interface:** A dark, terminal-style theme to make the challenge more engaging.
* **Client-Side Hashing:** The password check uses SHA-256 hashing, preventing the PIN from being visible in the source code in plain text.
* **Dynamic Hash Assembly:** The correct hash is built by JavaScript *after* the page loads, making it resistant to simple web scraping tools that don't render JavaScript.
* **Rate Limiting:** A small delay is implemented on failed attempts, demonstrating a basic defense mechanism against brute-force attacks.
